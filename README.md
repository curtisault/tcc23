# Tiny Code Christmas 2023 Ocaml Edition

## What is Tiny Code Christmas?

TCC is a series of graphical challenges to learn programming languages. I found this to be more enticing than Advent of Code.

## Why Ocaml?

BECAUSE.

## Requirements

MacOS: [XQuartz](https://formulae.brew.sh/cask/xquartz) is a requirement because the [graphics](https://github.com/ocaml/graphics) library in Ocaml utilizes the X11 server protocol to draw on the screen. After installation, logout or reboot.

Linux: [X11](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.7/doc/xproto/x11protocol.html) should come installed by default if not follow instructions on your package manager to install.

Windows: Uses the native Win32 API.
